          <p>Mercury is the smallest planet of the Solar System.</p>
          <p>Your weight on Mercury would be 38% of your weight on Earth.</p>
          <p>
            A day on the surface of Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. A year on
            Mercury takes 88 Earth days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface
            can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can
            reach 450 °C, but at night, temperatures can get as low as minus
            -170 °C. That fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than
            600 °C, the largest of any planet in the solar system.

            Here comes <a id="venus" class="anchor" href="#venus">Venus</a>.

        <section class="distance venus-to-earth">
          <p>
            Venus is the second brightest natural object in the sky. The planet
            has an apparent magnitude of -3.8 to -4.6, which makes it visible on
            a bright, clear day. The Moon is the only other natural object that
            is brighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day on Venus is longer than one year. Due to the slow rotation
            on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The
            orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days – making one year on Venus
            is shorter than making one day on Venus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average
            surface temperature of 462 °C (863 °F). Also, Venus doesn’t tilt on
            its axis which means there are no seasons either. The atmosphere is
            a dense 96.5% carbon dioxide which traps heat and caused the
            greenhouse effect which evaporated any water sources billions of
            years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The atmospheric pressure of Venus is 92 times stronger than Earth’s.
            This means that any small asteroids entering the atmosphere of Venus
            are crushed by the immense pressure, which is why there are no small
            surface craters on the planet. This pressure is equivalent to being
            around 1,000 km under Earth’s oceans.

            Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third
            planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe
            confirmed to host life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing. This deceleration is
            happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per
            hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly
            uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens
            so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the
            length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System. This varies
            according to the part of the planet; for example, the metallic core
            is denser than the crust. The average density of the Earth is
            approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimetre.
          </p>

            When astronauts first went into the space, they looked back at the
            Earth with human eyes for the first time, and called our home the
            Blue Planet. And it’s no surprise. 70% of our planet is covered with
            oceans. The remaining 30% is the solid ground, rising above sea
            level.

        </section>

        <section class="distance mars-to-jupiter">
          <p>
            Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass. Even though
            Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the
            Earth’s mass, around two thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in
            water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s (meaning
            you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar system. Olympus
            Mons, a shield volcano, is 21km high and 600km in diameter. Despite
            having formed over billions of years, evidence from volcanic lava
            flows is so recent many scientists believe it could still be active.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on Earth. At
            the closest point to the Sun, the Martian southern hemisphere leans
            towards the Sun, causing a short, intensely hot summer, while the
            northern hemisphere endures a brief, cold winter: at its farthest
            point from the Sun, the Martian northern hemisphere leans towards
            the Sun, causing a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere
            endures a lengthy, cold winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pieces of Mars have fallen to Earth. Scientists have found tiny
            traces of Martian atmosphere within meteorites violently ejected
            from Mars, then orbiting the solar system amongst galactic debris
            for millions of years, before crash landing on Earth. This allowed
            scientists to begin studying Mars prior to launching space missions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are signs of liquid water on Mars. For years Mars has been
            known to have water in the form of ice. The first signs of trickling
            water are dark stripes or stains on crater wall and cliffs seen in
            satellite images. Due to Mars’ atmosphere this water would have to
            be salty to prevent it from freezing or vaporising.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day Mars will have a ring. In the next 20-40 million years Mars’
            largest moon Phobos will be torn apart by gravitational forces
            leading to the creation of a ring that could last up to 100 million
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between Mars and Jupiter, there is region with asteroids. This
            region is called Asteroid Belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Asteroid Belt objects are made of rock and stone. Some are solid
            objects, while others are orbiting “rubble piles”. The Asteroid Belt
            contains billions and billions of asteroids.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know of at least 7,000 asteroids. The Asteroid Belt may contain
            many objects, but they are spread out over a huge area of space.
            This has allowed spacecraft to move through this region without
            hitting anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The formation of Jupiter disrupted the formation of any worlds in
            the Asteroid Belt region by scattering asteroids away. This caused
            them to collide and break into smaller pieces. Gravitational
            influences can move asteroids out of the Belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Asteroid Belt is often referred to as the “Main Belt” to
            distinguish it from other groups of asteroids such as the
            Lagrangians and Centaurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four largest asteroids in the belt are Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and
            Hygiea. They contain half the mass of the entire belt. The rest of
            the mass is contained in countless smaller bodies. There was a
            theory once that if you combined all the asteroids they would make
            up the missing “Fifth” rocky planet. Planetary scientists estimate
            that if you could put all that material together that exists there
            today, it would make a tiny world smaller than Earth’s moon.
