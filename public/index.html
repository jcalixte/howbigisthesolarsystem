        <h1>How big is the solar system?</h1>
        <h2>Well quite big.</h2>
        <p>
          You are about to begin a journey to the emptyness of the solar
          system... It may help you realize that the solar system is mainly
          void.

          <p>Bored?</p>
          <p>How about some fun facts along the way about the solar system?</p>
          <p>The Solar System formed around 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
          <p>
            The Sun contains 99.86% of the Solar System's known mass.

          <div class="mercury round"></div>
          <p>Well, this is Mercury. Yes, this little dot.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="distance mercury-to-venus">
          <p>Mercury is the smallest planet of the Solar System.</p>
          <p>Your weight on Mercury would be 38% of your weight on Earth.</p>
          <p>
            A day on the surface of Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. A year on
            Mercury takes 88 Earth days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface
            can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can
            reach 450 °C, but at night, temperatures can get as low as minus
            -170 °C. That fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than
            600 °C, the largest of any planet in the solar system.

          <p>Here comes Venus.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="distance venus-to-earth">
          <p>
            Venus is the second brightest natural object in the sky. The planet
            has an apparent magnitude of -3.8 to -4.6, which makes it visible on
            a bright, clear day. The Moon is the only other natural object that
            is brighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day on Venus is longer than one year. Due to the slow rotation
            on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The
            orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days – making one year on Venus
            is shorter than making one day on Venus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average
            surface temperature of 462 °C (863 °F). Also, Venus doesn’t tilt on
            its axis which means there are no seasons either. The atmosphere is
            a dense 96.5% carbon dioxide which traps heat and caused the
            greenhouse effect which evaporated any water sources billions of
            years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            The atmospheric pressure of Venus is 92 times stronger than Earth’s.
            This means that any small asteroids entering the atmosphere of Venus
            are crushed by the immense pressure, which is why there are no small
            surface craters on the planet. This pressure is equivalent to being
            around 1,000 km under Earth’s oceans.
